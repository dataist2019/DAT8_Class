## Project Proposal: Predicting which Mashable articles are going to be more successful

* Why did you choose this topic?

Mashable reached two million readers in its first 18 months. Today Mashable has over 20 million visitors. In early years it had the advantage of being an early adopter in a growing industry that was becoming of mainstream interest (digital media). Since then it has used smart tools (i.e. infographics) to promote its posts through social networks. Part of its success is because Mashable has gone beyond the 80/20 rule to reach the 52/1 rule, where 1% of its posts drives 52% of the traffic. In this scenario, know what is the recipe of the 1% is critical to Mashableâ€™s business objectives.

* What is the question you hope to answer?

The goal is to predict which articles will have the largest number of shares in social networks (popularity). I am curious to know what is/are the biggest predictor/s of success. Some of the hypotheses are: a) People are interested in blogs about leading tech companies i.e. Facebook, Google, Twitter b) People like blogs with several pictures, animations or visualization tools. 

* What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

The data that I want to use includes variables such as day of publication(Mon-Sun), wordcount, topic, number of links in article, number of photos in article, number of videos, number of keywords, and number of shares (in social media channels). 

* What do you know about the data so far?

Mashable released metadata of its articles published in 2011 and 2012.
